# Advanced Features

Explore advanced features and patterns for power users.

## Custom Matchers

Use predicates for advanced matching logic:

```csharp
mock.ForGet()
    .WithPath("/api/data")
    .With(request => request.Headers.Contains("X-API-Key"))
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.OK);
```

### Inspect Request Body

```csharp
mock.ForPost()
    .WithPath("/api/test")
    .With(req => req.Body!.Contains("something"))
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);
```

### Async Predicate Matching

```csharp
mock.ForGet()
    .WithPath("/api/async")
    .With(async req =>
    {
        await Task.Delay(1);
        return req.Uri!.Query == "?q=test";
    })
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.OK);
```

:::info
If no mock matches, an `UnexpectedRequestException` is thrown when `FailOnUnexpectedCalls` is `true` (default).
:::

## Body Matching

Match request bodies using different strategies:

### Wildcard Pattern

```csharp
mock.ForPost()
    .WithPath("/api/test")
    .WithBody("*something*")
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);
```

### JSON Equivalence

Layout and whitespace independent, using a raw JSON string:

```csharp
mock.ForPost()
    .WithPath("/api/json")
    .WithBodyMatchingJson("{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}")
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);
```

:::warning
If the body cannot be parsed as JSON for `WithBodyMatchingJson`, a `RequestMatchingException` is thrown.
:::

### Object Serialized to JSON

Pass an object directly and let Mockly serialize it to JSON for matching. This is useful when you have a strongly-typed request body:

```csharp
mock.ForPatch()
    .WithPath("/api/relationships/42")
    .WithBody(new
    {
        EntityKey = "TheRuleKey",
        RepresentativeId = "abc123"
    })
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);
```

The object is serialized using `JsonSerializer` with default options and compared to the request body using JSON equivalence, ignoring differences in whitespace and layout.

### Regular Expression

```csharp
mock.ForPost()
    .WithPath("/api/test")
    .WithBodyMatchingRegex(".*something.*")
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);
```

## Request Body Prefetching

By default, Mockly prefetches the request body for matchers. You can disable this to defer reading content inside your predicate:

```csharp
var mock = new HttpMock { PrefetchBody = false };

RequestInfo? captured = null;

mock.ForPost()
    .WithPath("/api/test")
    .With(req =>
    {
        captured = req; // req.Body can be read lazily here by your predicate
        return true;
    })
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.OK);
```

### What PrefetchBody Does

- **Purpose**: When `PrefetchBody` is `true` (default), Mockly eagerly reads and caches the HTTP request body into `RequestInfo.Body` so that matchers and later assertions can inspect it without re-reading the stream.
- **When to disable**: Turn it off for scenarios with large or streaming content where reading the body up front is expensive or undesirable. In that case, `RequestInfo.Body` will be `null` unless your own predicate reads it.
- **Impact on assertions**: Body-based assertions require the body to be available. Keep `PrefetchBody` enabled if you plan to assert on the request body after the call.

## Limiting Mock Invocations

Sometimes you want a mock to respond only a limited number of times. You can restrict a mock using the fluent methods `Once()`, `Twice()`, or `Times(int count)` on the request builder.

```csharp
var mock = new HttpMock();

// Single-use response
mock.ForGet()
    .WithPath("/api/item")
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.OK)
    .Once();

// Exactly two times
mock.ForPost()
    .WithPath("/api/items")
    .RespondsWithJsonContent(new { ok = true })
    .Twice();

// Exactly N times
mock.ForDelete()
    .WithPath("/api/items/*")
    .RespondsWithEmptyContent()
    .Times(3);
```

### Behavior Notes

- Exhausted mocks are skipped when matching. If no other non-exhausted mock matches and `FailOnUnexpectedCalls` is `true` (default), an `UnexpectedRequestException` is thrown.
- The mocks are evaluated in the order they were created.
- The default for mocks without limits is unlimited invocations
- The verification helpers consider limits:
  - `HttpMock.AllMocksInvoked` returns `true` only when each mock has been called at least once or has reached its configured `Times(..)` limit.
  - `HttpMock.GetUninvokedMocks()` lists mocks that haven't reached their required count (or have 0 calls for unlimited mocks).

## Request Collection

Capture requests for specific mocks:

```csharp
var capturedRequests = new RequestCollection();

mock.ForPatch()
    .WithPath("/api/update")
    .CollectingRequestIn(capturedRequests)
    .RespondsWithStatus(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);

// After making requests
capturedRequests.Count.Should().Be(2);
capturedRequests.First().WasExpected.Should().BeTrue();
```

## Assertions

### Verify All Mocks Were Called

```csharp
mock.Should().HaveAllRequestsCalled();
```

### Verify No Unexpected Requests

```csharp
mock.Requests.Should().NotContainUnexpectedCalls();
```

### Verify Request Expectations

```csharp
var request = mock.Requests.First();
request.Should().BeExpected();
request.WasExpected.Should().BeTrue();
```

### Assert an Unexpected Request

```csharp
var first = mock.Requests.First();
first.Should().BeUnexpected();
```

### Collection Assertions

```csharp
mock.Requests.Should().NotBeEmpty();
mock.Requests.Should().HaveCount(3);
capturedRequests.Should().BeEmpty();
```

### Body Assertions on Captured Requests

Use these to assert on the JSON body of a previously captured request:

```csharp
// Assert JSON-equivalence using a JSON string (ignores formatting/ordering)
mock.Requests.Should().ContainRequest()
    .WithBodyMatchingJson("{ \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"x\" }");

// Assert the body deserializes and is equivalent to an object graph
var expected = new { id = 1, name = "x" };
mock.Requests.Should().ContainRequest()
    .WithBodyEquivalentTo(expected);

// Assert the body has specific properties (deserialized as a dictionary)
var expectedProps = new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    ["id"] = "1",
    ["name"] = "x"
};
mock.Requests.Should().ContainRequest()
    .WithBodyHavingPropertiesOf(expectedProps);
```

:::info
These assertions operate on captured requests (`mock.Requests`). They are part of the FluentAssertions extensions shipped with Mockly. If you disabled `HttpMock.PrefetchBody`, `RequestInfo.Body` will be `null`; enable it when you need to assert on the body.
